​
The Palisadoes Foundation aims to provide new avenues of promoting Jamaica’s technology talent through a series of programs which create increased awareness of the island’s abilities in the global marketplace. It was founded by Jamaicans living in the United States.
​

Since 2016 we have managed the Calico Challenge that gives Jamaican students the opportunity to work on Open Source projects under the guidance of a mentor. Stipends are paid upon achieving pre-defined milestones. Funding is provided by the generous donations of many individuals and corporations. The open source projects available under the Palisadoes Foundation’s GitHub account. 

​
Calico is modeled on the Google Summer of Code. In 2021 The Palisadoes Foundation was awarded participation in the Google Summer of Code.
