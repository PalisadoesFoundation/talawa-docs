Here is a brief introduction to who we are and the Talawa projects.
### About Palisadoes

The Palisadoes Foundation aims to provide new avenues for promoting Jamaica’s technology talent through a series of programs which create increased awareness of the island’s abilities in the global marketplace. It was founded by Jamaicans living in the United States.
​

Since 2016 we have managed the Calico Challenge which gives Jamaican students the opportunity to work on Open-Source projects under the guidance of a mentor. Stipends are paid upon achieving pre-defined milestones. Funding is provided by the generous donations of many individuals and corporations. The open-source projects are available under the Palisadoes Foundation’s GitHub account.
​

Calico is modeled on the Google Summer of Code. In 2021 The Palisadoes Foundation was awarded participation in the Google Summer of Code.

### About Talawa

Talawa was created to help community-based organizations collaborate with their members. These organizations would include religious groups, non-profit charities, social groups, and in limited cases, businesses.
​
Though software applications exist for these types of organizations (eg. Breeze ChMS, The Realm) they assume their memberships are fully literate and have access to email. We wanted to create a system that would work for countries with similar technology and education challenges as Jamaica.
​
Talawa has three main components. A mobile application with social media features, a web-based portal to be used by the organization’s administrative team, and an API providing data and features access.
​​
The Palisadoes Foundation wants to eventually host Talawa as a cloud service to help finance its education outreach.
​
Talawa’s desired main features are:
​
1. User news feed
1. Event calendars with lightweight project management
1. Group chats
1. Member notifications
1. Donation acceptance
1. Service provider level multi-organization capability
1. Plugin support for administration services such as billing
