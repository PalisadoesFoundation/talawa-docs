> This page provides an overview as to what is expected from the Talawa API. Thereby increasing productivity and improving the application.

## API Primary Expectations

The API is expected to:

1. Centralize all functionality, meaning all applications must see the API as the source of truth.
2. Allow a secure connection to both frontend interfaces i.e., Admin console and Mobile application using industry standard API authorization.
3. Allow support for multiple file systems via centralized configuration e.g., server storage, AWS s3, etc...
4. Allow centralized configuration for all external service dependencies such as the email service and the database.
5. Support multi tenancy at its core

## Better TypeScript Workflow

Any improvements to the already existing typescript workflow are greatly appreciated. We want the contributors and developers to have good experience when working on the project. The improvements should try to automate as much stuff as possible so that there is less manual work required to work within the typescript environment.
