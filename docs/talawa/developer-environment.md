We have a test API server for software developers contributing to the talawa projects.

1. This is a good server to use to test your code prior to submitting a pull request
1. The server runs the latest ``master branch`` version of the ``talawa-api`` code base
    1. The URL to use for this in the Talawa App: https://talawa-graphql-api.herokuapp.com/
