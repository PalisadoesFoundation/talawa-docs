#### General Minimum Requirements for any student that we will assess

- Students should have at least one properly closed issue and merged PR made on the repository
- Students should be receptive to any feedback given to them by mentors
- Access to all required hardware and software for the development on our project
- Access to a stable internet connection

#### Areas of focus for our application. Students must clearly outline which areas they are interested in under the following. Students will be assessed on multiple areas of focus

- Talawa Front End
    - UI/UX designs & reviews
    - Development of UI
    - Development of Features & Functions
- Talawa API Backend
    - MongoDB Database
    - NodeJS
    - GraphQL
    - Security
- Talawa Admin Web Portal
    - TypeScript
    - GraphQL
    - Security
- DevOps
    - Deployment of Front and Back End
    - CI/CD Pipeline for Front and Back end
    - QA

_NB: Students will have to work on multiple aspects of the application, but breaking it down will give everyone a more “clear cut” role when they’re deciding what to work on. (i.e. A student won’t be accepted if they're only willing to do UI/UX designs and reviews. If a student would like to work on all areas related to the front end, that would be fine.)_

Mentors may at any point decide to interview with any applicant to decide whether they are suitable for selection. This is completely optional, so students may be accepted without participating in an interview.
