title: Selection Criteria
---


Each applicant to The Palisadoes Foundation’s Talawa programs will be assessed using the following criteria

1. Previous Contributions to the Talawa repositories
    1. This includes contribution before the selection period officially starts
2. Communication Skills
3. Technical Knowledge & Skill

The above broad criteria will be expanded on below.

## Criteria

Read this carefully.

### Contributions

We will consider your previous contributions to the relevant Talawa repositories. Factors include:

 1. The quality of Issues and Pull Requests (PR)
 2. The detrimental impact of low quality Issues and PRs. We generally **ignore** these when assessing participants. Do not get a reputation for doing this.
 3. The impact of your mergde merged PRs to our software.

In summary be a conscientious contributor to our long term goals of sustainable software development for the unmet needs of community based organizations.

## Proposals

The quality of the submitted proposals are important.

### Communication Skills

We value collaboration greatly. Therefore the value of your participation in the community will be assessed. This includes your:
 1. Behaviour and Attitude toward mentors and other contributors
     1. Were participants respectful when interacting with others?
     2. Did participants handle disputes appropriately?
     3. Did participants perform any malicious actions to gain an unfair advantage for themselves or to deter others?
 2. Knowledge in using collab tools such as GitHub
     1. Appropriate format for contributions were used when creating issues and PRS
     2. Accuracy when following contribution guidelines
     3. Collaboration tools were used appropriately (i.e. Bad practices such as ‘force pushes’ in git were not used)

Our contributors are spread out around the globe from cultures and backgrounds unknown to you. Each repository has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file outlining additional steps you can take to be a better participant.

### Technical Knowledge and Skill

You should have experience in the techologies we use in the projects. You will not be effective without it. We therefore expect:

 1. Knowledge of our tech stack (Flutter, NodeJS, Mongo, etc.)
     1. Experience using our stack
     2. Previous projects to show affinity with our stack
     3. Willingness to learn our stack
 2. Knowledge of deploying systems
     1. Deploying backend applications to cloud services
     2. Deploying frontend applications to appropriate mobile stores (Google Play Store & Apple App Store)
 3. Ability to finish the tasks in a prompt manner and create a productive workflow.
     1. Ability to independently work on an issue or feature
     2. High standars of code quality. It must be:
         1. Maintainable
         2. Readable
         3. Documented
         4. Verifiably testable

We want you to be successful and these requirements help to ensure this happens.

## Minium Requirements

We need to maintain good code quality therefore we maintain general minimum requirements for any participant that we assess.

### General 

We expect that:
1. Participants should have at least one properly closed issue and merged PR made on the repository
2. Participants should be receptive to any feedback given to them from mentors
3. Access to all required hardware and software for development on our project
4. Access to a stable internet connection

Without these prerequisities you will not be successful.

### Proposals

These are some general areas of focus for our application. Participants must clearly outline which areas they are interested in under the following. Participants will be assessed on multiple areas such as:

1. Talawa Front End
    1. UI/UX designs & reviews
    2. Development of UI
    3. Development of Features & Functions
2. Talawa API Backend
    1. MongoDB Database
    2. NodeJS
    3. GraphQL
    4. Security
3. Talawa Admin Web Portal
    1. TypeScript
    2. GraphQL
    3. Security
4. DevOps
    1. Deployment of Front and Back End
    2. CI/CD Pipeline for Front and Back end
    3. QA

_NB: Participants will have to work on multiple aspects of the application, but breaking it down will give everyone a more “clear cut” role when they’re deciding what to work on. (i.e. A student won’t be accepted if they're only willing to do UI/UX designs and reviews. If a student would like to work on all areas related to the front end, that would be fine.)_

Mentors may at any point decide to hold an interview with any applicant to decide whether they are suitable for selection. This is completely optional, so participants may be accepted without participating in an interview.
