## Intern at The Palisadoes Foundation

This is an educational opportunity to work with the organization that sponsors the Talawa projects.

As an intern, you will work closely with the Palisadoes Foundation (TPF) volunteers in your area of interest, such as UX/UI design, systems administration, Talawa project support, or GitHub software development, and technical writing.

All applicants must be:

1. open-minded and tolerant of others,
1. able to work as part of a team, and
1. interested in supporting our computing projects that make communities thrive.

Our volunteers are dispersed globally, so all internships will be remote.

These positions are unpaid. TPF will provide any appropriate documentation you might need to receive funding and school credit from outside sources. We place an emphasis on providing educational opportunities for interns in which they work closely with our volunteer mentors. [Take a look at our past interns](https://www.palisadoes.org/internship-alumni/).

We are especially interested in adding features to our software that makes it:

1. More intuitive to use
1. Support multiple organizations as a cloud service
1. Able to accept payments and donations
1. Reliable
1. Very clearly documented

## Schedule

The application period for summer internships is open. Deadline for applications: May 31, 2021.

Each position lasts for one twelve-week term, starting June 15. There can be some flexibility with start and end dates if necessary.

Work during the term can be either full time (forty hours per week) or part-time (twenty hours per week) positions. We will prefer candidates able to work full time, particularly during the summer term.
