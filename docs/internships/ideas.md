Welcome to our ideas landing page. We know that this is the most important page for our internships. That's why we put it first!

## Internship Proposal Ideas

Here are the proposal ideas for the various programs in which we participate:

1. [GSoC Ideas](./gsoc/ideas.md): All you need to know about our multi-year involvement with the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
1. [Calico Challenge Ideas](./calico/ideas.md): Calico shares the same idea list as GSoC.
1. [GSoD Ideas](./gsod/ideas.md): High quality documentation is necessary for all our various participants from user, to developers and more. These ideas help to make our software more usable.

Show us your best!
