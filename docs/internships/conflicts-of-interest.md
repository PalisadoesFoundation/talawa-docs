title: Conflicts of Interest
---

We pride ourselves on being fair, both in actions and perception.

This is our simple conflict of interest policy for our internship programs.

## Professionalism

We strive to be a community that applies the appropriate levels of professionalism in our interactions. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files found in the root directory of each repository outlines what we mean by this.

## Types of Conflicts of Interest

The conflicts that we are most concerned with are listed here:

### Candidates

If you personally know anyone in the Palisadoes Foundation GitHub community who can assign issues or merge PRs then they must not:

1. Formally evaluate your internship proposals
2. Assign issues to you
3. Review your pull requests
4. Merge your pull requests

We also err on the side of caution and therefore apply these criteria to persons currently attending the same educational institutions and/or working with the same companies.

It's important that all candidates are evaluated on the merit of their contributions and proposals as objectively as possible.

### Mentors

All mentors: 

1. Are aware of the candidate guidelines above and will abide by them or have their GitHub privileges revoked.
2. Have been instructed to inform all other mentors of any potential conflicts and recuse themselves from the candidate activities above.

Our volunteers want everyone to feel accepted into the community on these terms of integrity.

## Reporting
The administrators of the repositories are committed to these goals. Let them know of any concerns you have via our community forums, email or the Palisadoes Foundation website. We will handle the matter with confidentiality.
