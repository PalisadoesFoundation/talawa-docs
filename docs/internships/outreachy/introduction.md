## About Outreachy

Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. We help newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions.

Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. [Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/) projects may include programming, user experience or documentation.

The Outreachy internship application has two phases:

1. the first stage is called [initial application](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#initial-application) and
2. the second stage is called the [contribution period](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#application-prep).
