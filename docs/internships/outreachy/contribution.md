### Introduction

The Palisadoes Foundation has sponsored work on Talawa projects for some years now. Talawa is an open-source project to help community-based organizations such as clubs, neighbourhood groups, religious institutions etc manage their daily activities.

The Talawa application has 3 components:

1. Talawa-API
1. Talawa
1. Talawa-Admin

You can learn more about Palisodes Foundation and Talawa projects **[here](docs/about.md)** or in the FAQ and its [core concepts](docs/applications/overview.md). You can learn about Talawa  [applications](docs/applications/architecture.md).
