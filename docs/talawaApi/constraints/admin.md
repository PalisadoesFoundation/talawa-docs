## Who Is An Administrator (`Admin`)?

Administrators are users who have the ability to manage organizations.

They can change organization details, remove members from public organizations and moderate membership for private organizations, meaning they can accept or reject membership requests.

Administrators can remove any event, group chat or post belonging to the organization their responsible for.

An administrator for an organization would be similar to a pastor for a church or the manager of a business.

## What should an `Admin` do ?

    1. Assign available roles to users.

    2. Grant elevated access to organisation features to support its management and moderation.

    3. Demote a member from an elevated position, restricting elevated access.

    4. Block a specific member for a valid reason
