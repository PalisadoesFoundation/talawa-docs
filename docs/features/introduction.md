### Admin Capabilities
With this feature, the organization admins and coordinators will have a suite of tools to manage and moderate their organizations with ease. From adding and removing members to managing group chats and events, our advanced admin capabilities will simplify and streamline the entire process.

One of the key features of this feature is the ability for the organization creator to set the organization status as either public or private, giving them complete control over who can join and access the organization's content. Additionally, admins will have the ability to switch between multiple organizations with ease, allowing for efficient management of all their organizations in one place.

With our advanced admin capabilities, admins and coordinators would be able to elevate members to coordinators and moderate the newsfeed by enabling or disabling comments and allowing for thumbs up or down reactions. Admins can also mute users and send organization-wide messages for effective communication.

We understand that managing organizations can be challenging, but with our advanced admin capabilities, we are confident that admins and coordinators will find managing their organizations to be a breeze.

### Chat and Messaging
As a potential feature that we aim to develop, we plan to introduce a Chat and Messaging module to enhance communication and collaboration among users. This module will allow any user to create a group chat, enabling them to connect and interact with other members of the organization.

In addition, we plan to integrate automatic group chat creation for events, ensuring that all confirmed attendees can communicate and coordinate effectively. Members of an organization will also be able to send messages to each other through various group chats, promoting collaboration and facilitating communication.

To support effective communication from the organization's leadership, we plan to offer broadcast messaging capabilities, allowing admin and coordinators to send important updates and announcements to all members of the organization. Additionally, we will introduce one-on-one messaging capabilities, enabling users to communicate privately with each other.

As a unique feature, we plan to introduce voice messaging capability with compression, enabling users to communicate more effectively by sending voice messages without consuming excessive bandwidth or storage. By offering these features, we aim to enhance the functionality and user experience of the Chat and Messaging module, promoting collaboration and facilitating communication among users.

Additionally, users will be able to sign up and subscribe to events, ensuring that they receive updates and notifications as necessary.

Another significant feature is the ability to assign roles and responsibilities, enabling organizers to delegate tasks and streamline event management. Users will also have access to view attendee lists and rosters, ensuring that they can track event participation and make informed decisions accordingly.

To support monetization efforts, we plan to offer the ability to create paid or donation-based events, providing a flexible and convenient way for organizations to generate revenue. Users will also be able to comment on events, as well as express their feedback using a thumbs up or down mechanism.

Other essential features include event management, scheduling, and reminders, ensuring that organizers can effectively manage and communicate event details to attendees. Additionally, users will have access to a calendar overview, allowing them to easily track and manage upcoming events.
