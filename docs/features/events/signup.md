## Overview

### Problem

1. **Currently the user cannot subscribe to or sign up as an attendee of an event :**
    1. All events in the organization are presented ungrouped to the user
    2. The user cannot subscribe/ sign up for an event

### Goals

1. **Provide streamlined display of events:** This should eventually facilitate the development of other event-type specific features

### Out of Scope

The following are aspects of this feature which have been considered but are outside of the scope for the current project:

1. **Invite non-app users to events :** Prompting then to install the app and join the organization and subscribe for the event.
2. **View assigned tasks from the event screen/page:** User is able to select an event and see all tasks assigned to then for that event
3. **Volunteer for tasks under an event :** From the events screen/page the user is able volunteer for the listed tasks under the event

### People and Roles

The following are the primary roles foreseen in the development of this feature

1. **Feature Lead** : will review proposed solutions, acceptance and close feature .

## Context

### Use Cases

1. **Members want to:**
    1. **Subscribe to Events** : enabling them to receive notifications, view updates and be marked as an attendee to this event.
1. **Admins want to** :
    1. **View attendee list for events** : once a member subscribes for an event, they are listed as an attendee and can be viewed as an attendee from the admin portal.
    2. **View the number of subscribers/ attendees for events:**
1. **Coordinators want to** :
    1. **View attendee/ subscription lists for events:** allowing them to assign these members to tasks under the event.

## Proposal/Solution

### User Experience

1. From the events tab on the main menu a user should see all events for the organization
2. The user should select an event and be presented with the option to subscribe/ attend organization
3. The member is then listed as an attendee of the event

### Important Details To Capture

NA

### Future Work

1. Items mentioned in the Out of scope section will form the basis for future work to be done on this feature
