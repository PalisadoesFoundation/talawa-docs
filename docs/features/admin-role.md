## Overall Guidance

We will assume that at least one person in the organization has access to a traditional computer device with a non-mobile size screen to help them do administrative tasks via the portal.

### Functions from App
Administrators will also need to be able to do some portal tasks from their phones such as:

1. Add/ remove members
2. Set Organisation status public or private
3. Create/Update/Delete group chats
4. Create/Update/Delete events
5. Add/ Remove Admins
   1. Only the organization's creator can remove admins
6. Manage and switch between multiple organization   
7. Sending organization wide messages
8. Elevating members to coordinators
9. Moderating Newsfeed
    1. Mute people
    2. Enable/ disable commenting on posts
    3. Thumbs up/down
   
### Functions from Admin Portal
1. Determine whether membership to the organization is public or private
2. Add or remove members
