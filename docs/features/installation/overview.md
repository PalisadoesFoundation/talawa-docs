# Overall Guidance

We need to ensure that the app, the API and the admin portal install flawlessly, ideally with a single click. The only parameters that should be required are:

1. **App:** None for installation, however the registration process should be initiated upon starting the app. Registration should be as easy as possible.
2. **API:** Backend database authentication parameters, hostname, username, password. Not much more.
3. **Admin Portal:** API URI, admin username and password with verification. Not much more.

Use the ease of installation of other social media apps like LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp as a guide.
