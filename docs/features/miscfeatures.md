## Multilingual Capabilities

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** __. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **enable language support** _ by _ **using the** _ **i18n Internationalization standard for supported languages within the application**.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Users of the application live in many different countries :**
Therefore, support for multiple languages is essential for an unbiased experience regardless of location.

### Goals

1. **Support for all languages currently in use world-wide** :
 Starting with the most widely used languages, support for multiple languages needs to be integrated within the application.

### Out of Scope

1. **Dying Languages** : although it would be good to solve the problem of dying languages across the globe, limited information on these languages makes it an unfeasible task for internationalization only to tackle.

### People and Roles

1. **Xavier Bryson (Feature Lead)**: clarify functionality and assumptions.

## Context

### Use Cases

1. **All users want to:**
  1. **Choose their preferred language** : having an easy to access way for users to switch the default language of the application removes a barrier for use globally.
