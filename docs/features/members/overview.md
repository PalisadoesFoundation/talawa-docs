## Overall Guidance

This section aims to give an outline of the features that make up the core of how members operate within Talawa and by extension the organisation. We will cover features such as:

1. Member Registration
2. Member Roles
3. Validating users for the organization
4. Access Banning 
5. Access Recovering

## Member Registration
This feature requires the creation and implementation of a unique identifier for each member of the organization. This identifier will allow for accurate tracking of each member's activity within the app and enable personalized user experiences. It is imperative to ensure that the identification process is secure and that user privacy is maintained. By having a unique identifier for each user, it will be easier to analyze user behavior, provide better customer support, and identify and address any issues that may arise.

## Member Roles
Assigning roles to team members is a crucial feature that enables a personalized experience for each user within an application. Through the allocation of a defined set of roles, access to specific features can be granted based on the assigned role, ensuring that only relevant features are available. This feature enhances application security and efficiency by limiting access to pertinent features and preventing unauthorized personnel from accessing sensitive data. It also improves team management by allowing administrators to easily assign or modify roles to ensure appropriate access levels for everyone. In summary, assigning roles is critical in enhancing the security, efficiency, and user experience within an application. [Click here to know more](./members-roles) 

## Validating users via pre-approvals
The incorporation of a user validation method during the signup process for an organization is a vital feature that enhances the security of the application. This feature provides a secure mechanism for approving new members registering for an organization within the app.

By enabling the administrator to oversee the registration and approval process, this feature allows for a streamlined and intuitive experience for both the administrator and the users. The process should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, ensuring that the members can register with ease while providing the admin with the necessary tools to review and approve new members.

This feature is crucial in ensuring the security of the application by providing a method of user validation and approval. The ability to monitor and approve new members allows the admin to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to the organization within the app, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

Overall, the incorporation of this feature provides enhanced security to the application, while also providing a seamless and intuitive experience for both the admin and the members. [Click here to know more](./members-preapprovals)

## Access Banning 
Given the sensitivity of an organization's information, it is crucial to have measures in place that restrict unauthorized access. In case of a member's malicious intentions or loss of access to their account, a mechanism is necessary to prevent access from that particular device or account. This feature aims to achieve this objective by enabling admins to ban accounts, phone numbers, or device IDs from accessing the application. It is essential to note that banned accounts should only be restricted from accessing the organization from which they are banned to maintain a secure and seamless user experience.

## Access Recovery
To provide a more secure and seamless experience for our users, we aim to implement a feature that allows for account recovery. In the event that a user loses their login credentials, they should have an independent and secure way of regaining access to their account.

This feature will also capture information on account recovery in logs, which can be accessed by the admin through the admin portal. This will enable the admin to keep track of account recovery attempts and ensure that the process runs smoothly.

Overall, the account recovery feature will provide an additional layer of security and convenience for our users, while also facilitating efficient management of the recovery process for our admin team.  [Click here to know more](./members-recovery)
