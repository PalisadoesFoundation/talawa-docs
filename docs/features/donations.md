### Code: DON-005

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** _ _. Last updated on_ _ **4/04/21** _

This feature aims to _ **manage privileged access** _ by _ **use of fees associated with certain features/terms of use** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Some organization&#39;s require a means of generating revenue to fund their operations :**
 Since the target audience of the application would be those similar to non-profits if not non-profits themselves, a crucial part of their revenue would be from their members/participants. Therefore, a means to manage member contributions would need to be established and should be easy to configure.

### Goals

1. **Allow for a secure method of receiving donations online** :
 Through the use of a payment gateway for ease of management and integrations, we can allow members to offer secure payments on fees to access exclusive events/features.
2. **Differentiate the various fees associated with features/terms of use** :
 Currently, there are three main categories for fees within the application, namely: Donations and Membership Fees. 
    - Donations: These are fees that can be contributed at any time by members/participants of an organization.
    - Membership Fees: Similar to donations, membership fees can be contributed at any time or can be associated with a certain event. These fees can also be one-time or recurring.
    - Plugin Fees: These are payments made to grant access to certain features of the application.

## Proposal/Solution

1. For ease of managing transactions, external Billing Systems would need to be employed. Two recommendations are as follows:
    
    ○ Stripe

    ○ Paypal

2. For ease of incorporation into the various endpoints a node/express middleware could be used to pre-validate requests.
