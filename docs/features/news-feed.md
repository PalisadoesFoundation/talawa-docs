## Pinned Posts

This section is a work in progress.

### Code: PPD

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** _ _. Last updated on_ _ **20/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **highlight posts** _ by _ **allowing the** _ **pinning of posts to the top of the news feed**.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Admins require a means of sharing important information to all members of an organization:**
The pinning of posts will therefore prevent such information from being lost within the news feed.

### Goals

1. **Provide a section at the top of the news feed for displaying multiple pinned posts** :
If multiple posts are pinned, the area will cycle through each by manner of a carousel. Indicators of carousel functionality such as manual cycling and slide count should be present.

### People and Roles

## Proposal/Solution
