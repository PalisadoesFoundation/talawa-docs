## Pre-Approvals

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** __. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **provide more security within the signup process** _ by _ **incorporating a method for validating new users registering for an organization within the app** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Anyone is able to sign up for an organization within the application:**

We need a method for administrators to pre-approve users. Additionally, we need to assume that users may not have access to email and that text message service integration will not be immediately available.

### Goals

1. **Allow for a secure method of approving new members to an organization within the app** :
 Enable the admin to oversee the registration and/or approval of members to an organization. The process should be seamless and intuitive to both users (Admin &amp; Members) of the application.

### Out of Scope

N/A

### People and Roles

1. **Xavier Bryson (Feature Lead)**: Make decision on final solution.


## Context

### Use Cases

TBD.

## Proposal/Solution

1. A pre-approved list of phone numbers.

2. QR code approvals by admins or their lieutenants through the app

3. One time password/token given to the user generated by admins

 Note: Ideally the QR code should contain all the organizations API login information so that it doesn&#39;t need to be rekeyed.

### User Experience

1. Solution 1:
  1. Admins will have access to a list of registered numbers from the admin dashboard.
  2. Admins will be able to select a number from the list and approve/deny access.
  3. Members will receive an email/ in app notification once granted access.

1. Solution 2:
  1. Admins will have access to a screen containing a unique QR code.
  2. Admins will have the ability to regenerate the QR code (to be discussed)
  3. Member&#39;s will have access to a QR code scanner upon opening the app.

2. Solution 3:
  1. Admins will have access to a list of registered numbers.
  2. Admins will be able to select a number from the list and generate a unique token/password for a member.
  3. Admins will have access to a share button for sending the token/password to a member&#39;s email/whatsapp/phone number.
  4. Member&#39;s will be required to enter the info from the previous step after registering for an organization.

OR

Member&#39;s will be required to enter the provided token while registering for an organization.

## Account Banning

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** __. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **limit unwanted access** _ by _ **allowing admins to ban accounts, numbers or phone ids from accessing the application** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Access to an organization&#39;s information is sensitive :**
 As such if a member&#39;s intentions is deemed as malicious or of no benefit to the organization, or if a member loses access to his/her device/account, there needs to be a method for limiting access for that device/account.

## Member Registration

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** __. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **enable member access** _ by _ **allowing members to register for an organization with the use of a unique identifier.** _

## Overview

### Problem

1. **We need a unique way of tracking users :**

Members within the organization need a unique identifier for their devices/accounts.

### Goals

N/A

### Out of Scope

1. **SMS OTP** : to avoid costs within the application, this feature will be omitted as a paid third-party service is required .
2. **Email Registration:** A common issue faced by users is that access to their emails is non existent as they do not own one or it is done so on a need to basis.

## Account/Access Recovery

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** __. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **prevent account loss** _ by _ **allowing members to recover their access via email** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Users may lose access to their device/account:**

The losing of access to one&#39;s account prevents them from being productive and informed within an organization.

### Goals

1. **Allow members a secure way of recovering their account** :

User&#39;s should have an independent way of recovering access to their account should they lose their credentials.

### Out of Scope

1. **SMS Integration** : we will only support email notifications at this time however with funding this can be revisited in the future.

### People and Roles

1. **Xavier Bryson (Feature Lead)**: clarify functionality and assumptions.

Information on account recovery should be captured in logs and displayed within the admin portal.
