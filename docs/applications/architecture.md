The suite of Talawa applications make the management of community based organizations easier. There are three major components.

1. Talawa-API
1. Talawa
1. Talawa-Admin

### Talawa API

This is the heart of the Talawa applications it governs access to the database of society's users

### Talawa

This is the mobile app used by members of an organization. It helps create closer interactions through features such a newsfeed, events, and chat.

### Talawa Admin

The admin web portal manages all the administrative functions necessary for Talawa to work smoothly. This includes management of:

1. Members
1. Events
1. Newsfeeds
1. Plugins for donations and more

In future we'd like this application to include:

1. Reserving facilities for events
