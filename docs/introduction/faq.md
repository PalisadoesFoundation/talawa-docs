#### Q: How is Talawa different from other community based organizations?
Ans: Though software applications exist for these types of organizations (eg. Breeze ChMS, The Realm), they assume their memberships are fully literate and have access to email. But we wanted to create a system that would work for countries with similar technology and education challenges as Jamaica.​
