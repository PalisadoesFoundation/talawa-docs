### What does 'Talawa' mean, how do I pronounce it?
Talawa is a Jamaican Patois word that means to be strong, fearless, strong-willed, and not to be underestimated. Jamaicans have always had a motto that encapsulates this idea of being great: 'We likkle but we talawa'. It means that we may be small, but we are strong, we are mighty, and can do anything. It is pronounced exactly as it is spelled: /Tala-wa/.

### How is Talawa different from other community based organizations?
Many other similar softwares assume their memberships are fully literate and have access to email. We wanted to create a system that would work for countries with similar technology and education challenges as Jamaica.​ We also offer two levels of administrative roles, which allows more nuanced scheduling and planning for organizations with more than one chapter.

### What is Palisadoes?
The Palisadoes Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Our mission is to provide equitable access to life opportunities for STEM education recipients.

Palisadoes was created by a group of expatriate Jamaican information and communication technology (ICT) professionals. They wanted to assist the continued development of new and existing technologies for the benefit of the island.

The Foundation quickly realized that there was universal need for these services in underserved communities where the Jamaican diaspora live. We have expanded our service region to include them.
