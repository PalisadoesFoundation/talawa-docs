Google is sponsoring the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [The Palisadoes Foundation](http://www.palisadoes.org) is registered as a mentoring organization. This page is your entry point to the Palisadoes Foundation GSoC program. Please watch this page for updates concerning our participating this year.

### About Talawa

The Palisadoes Foundation has been sponsoring work on this open-source project for a number of years. We hope to launch it in alpha at the end of the summer. Talawa is a modular open source project to help community-based organizations such as clubs, neighborhood groups, volunteer associations, non-profits and small religious institutions manage their daily activities. Most user interaction is via a mobile app.
