## Overall Guidance

We need to ensure that the app, the API and the admin portal install flawlessly, ideally with a single click. The only parameters that should be required are:

1. **App:** None for installation, however the registration process should be initiated upon starting the app. Registration should be as easy as possible. [Issue #797](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa/issues/797)
2. **API:** Backend database authentication parameters, hostname, username, password. Not much more. [Issue #241](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-api/issues/241)
3. **Admin Portal:** AP URI, admin username and password with verification. Not much more. [Issue #18](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues/18)

Use the ease of installation of other social media apps like LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp as a guide.
