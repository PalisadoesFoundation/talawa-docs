## Overall Guidance

### Creating Organizations

Organizations should only be created via the portal. 
The portal should be able to support the creation of multiple organizations to assist in creating the cloud service.

### Organizational Admins

**NB:** There are two types of admins.

***Organizational Creator Admin (OCA)*** -  The creator of the organization is more like a super admin. Ie, the creator is the only one with privilege to add or delete admins and delete organizations. 
***NB:*** OCA has every privilege an organizational admin has.


***Organizational Admin*** - Added by the Creator. Has privilege to the rest of admin privilege.
