## Overview

### Problem

1. **Admins require a means of sharing important information to all members of an organization:**

### Goals

1. **Provide a section at the top of the news feed for displaying multiple pinned posts** :
If multiple posts are pinned, the area will cycle through each by manner of a carousel. Indicators of carousel funtionality such as manual cycling and slide count should be present.
