## Code: MEM-006

_Authored by_ _ **Xavier Bryson** _ _. Last updated on_ _ **14/03/21** _

This feature aims to _ **prevent account loss** _ by _ **allowing members to recover their access via email** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **Users may lose access to their device/account:**

The losing of access to one&#39;s account prevents them from being productive and informed within an organization.

### Goals

1. **Allow members a secure way of recovering their account** :

User&#39;s should have an independent way of recovering access to their account should they lose their credentials.

### Out of Scope

1. **SMS Integration** : we will only support email notifications at this time however with funding this can be revisited in the future.

### People and Roles

1. **Xavier Bryson (Feature Lead)**: clarify functionality and assumptions.
