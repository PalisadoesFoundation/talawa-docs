Talawa is a modular open source project to manage group activities of both non-profit organizations and businesses.

Core features include:

1.  Membership management
2.  Groups management
3.  Event registrations
4.  Recurring meetings
5.  Facilities registrations

`talawa` is based on the original `quito` code created by the [Palisadoes Foundation][pfd] as part of its annual Calico Challenge program. Calico provides paid summer internships for Jamaican university students to work on selected open source projects. They are mentored by software professionals and receive stipends based on the completion of predefined milestones. Calico was started in 2015. Visit [The Palisadoes Foundation's website](http://www.palisadoes.org/) for more details on its origin and activities.

# Running the Development Server

To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and it will reflect the latest changes.

Follow these steps:

**Note:** Install the latest stable version of Node.js on your system if you get a `The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version` message during the procedure below. You may need to use a custom repository for this.

- Please bear in mind that to install docusaurus your system, a Node.js version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running node -v) is required. Other requirements that pertains to the installation of docusaurus can be found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation)

```console
$ sudo apt-get -y install npm
$ sudo npm install --global yarn
$ cd talawa-docs
$ yarn add docusaurus
$ yarn run start
OR
$ yarn run
```

By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

# Building Static HTML Pages

**In most cases is unnecessary**. Running the `development server` will be sufficient.

If you need to generate static HTML pages (unlikely), then follow these steps.

```console
$ yarn run build
```

This command generates static content into the `/build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
